# Decisions Log

## D-0001
Git is the single source of truth.

## D-0002
English is the canonical project language.
Russian is a synchronized translation.

## D-0003
Engineering over Perfection.

## D-0004
The project consists of a White Paper, Architecture Specification and Reference Implementation.

## D-0005
Kernel must remain independent of any specific LLM.

## D-0006
Project memory is layered.

## D-0007
Every document must be reachable from repository navigation.

## D-0008
Every Patch must leave the repository in a consistent, navigable state.

## D-0009
Repository content overrides chat history.

## D-0010
BOOT.md defines the canonical repository loading sequence.

## D-0011
SYSTEM_PROMPT.md defines permanent behavioural rules.

## D-0012
Every commit must improve the repository as a complete knowledge system.

## D-0013
Recurring engineering practices must be documented as repository protocols.

## D-0014
No important project knowledge may remain only inside chat history.

## D-0015
The repository stores both project knowledge and engineering processes.

## D-0016
A commit should represent exactly one conceptual change.

## D-0017
Validate Before Elaborating.
Implement new architectural layers only after validating the previous ones.

## D-0018
Infrastructure Before Features.
Improve development infrastructure before relying on new capabilities.


## D-0019
Patch Format v2 is the standard modification format. Large documents should be modified incrementally instead of being fully overwritten.

## D-0020
Human assistance is a fallback mechanism. Every automatic repository access method must be attempted before requesting manual intervention.

## D-0021
The repository should be executable engineering memory. A new session should recover project state from the repository rather than chat history.


## D-0022
The success criterion for repository memory is a Zero Context Recovery Test. A new LLM session must be able to resume the project using only the repository.

## D-0023
Every repository boot must produce a standardized Boot Report. Boot success is determined by loading repository state rather than by subjective interpretation.

## D-0024
Phase 0 is complete only after a successful Zero Context Recovery Test and correction of all deficiencies discovered during that test.

## D-0025
The repository must always define exactly one current engineering task. LLMs should execute that task instead of inferring the next objective.

## D-0026
Direct git commits are the standard modification mechanism when the LLM has repository access. The patch mechanism (apply.py) is retained only as a fallback for environments without repository access.

## D-0027
Supervision of the Lead model is split by reliability requirements: Guard (deterministic budget enforcement, no LLM), Ledger (deterministic analytics, no LLM), Analyst (small LLM over telemetry, on demand). The cost of supervision must be measurably lower than the savings it produces.

## D-0028
Delegation decisions are driven by DELEGATION_TABLE.md. The initial table is estimated up front and refined continuously by Shadow Evaluation during implementation; a long measurement phase is explicitly rejected.

## D-0029
The Router is deferred until telemetry from Phase 1 shows what is worth routing.
