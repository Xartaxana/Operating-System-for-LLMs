# Current Context

## Current Milestone

Phase 1 — Supervised Lead (MVP), step 5: Shadow Evaluation.

## Current Status

Phase 0 closed 2026-07-03. Phase 1 steps 1–4 built and verified:

- Gateway (step 1): LiteLLM proxy + SQLite request logging.
- Guard (step 2): daily per-model budgets, warn 80% / refuse 100%.
- Ledger (step 3): metrics.py daily digest (text/JSON).
- Analyst (step 4): analyst.py feeds the Ledger digest to a local
  Qwen3-4B (Ollama) through the gateway under its own alias, so
  supervision cost is accounted separately. Verified live: answered
  a Russian operator question from real telemetry. Answer quality is
  Intern-class (numbers occasionally garbled) — acceptable for MVP,
  prompt to be tuned on real telemetry.

Free-telemetry mode is in place (no paid keys needed): local models
`intern` and `analyst` (Ollama Qwen3-4B) run through the gateway with
synthetic Haiku-class per-token prices, so Guard/Ledger money paths
work at $0. `lead` (Anthropic API, paid) stays optional.

Environment notes (this machine): Ollama 0.31.1 installed via winget.
NVIDIA driver updated 560.94 → 582.28 (last Pascal security branch),
which fixed the Ollama CUDA PTX error: Qwen3-4B now runs 100% on the
GTX 1060 GPU, warm requests ~5 s vs ~15 s on CPU. Proxy must be
started from gateway/ (callback imports are cwd-relative).

Open operational item (Architect): route real traffic through the
gateway to accumulate telemetry (free via intern/analyst;
lead needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, paid).

Test-traffic alias `lead-sonnet` (anthropic/claude-sonnet-5) added to
gateway/config.yaml for future Shadow Evaluation baselines, but unused
for now: no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in this environment. Working set for
Shadow Evaluation instead generated via `intern` (Ollama, free): 6
requests across coding/summarization/extraction/classification/
formatting categories, logged in gateway/requests.db (38% context
repetition observed on this tiny sample — not meaningful yet, needs
volume).

Planned (not yet done): add Gemini and Groq free-tier aliases to
config.yaml for traffic diversity. Rationale: local Ollama traffic
alone can't validate delegation decisions against a real frontier
Lead — Gemini/Groq free tiers give real remote latency and real
provider pricing at $0, useful once comparing delegation candidates
against genuine frontier-Lead output (vs. `lead-sonnet` once a paid
key is available).

## Current Objective

Phase 1 step 5: Shadow Evaluation. gateway/shadow_eval.py is built and
tested (11 passing tests, no live model needed — mock_response like
test_analyst.py): samples successful requests for --source-model,
replays them on --target-model, compares via difflib similarity
(transparent heuristic, LLM judge deferred), aggregates by the same
task category metrics.py uses, and (--update-table) writes
validated/rejected verdicts into DELEGATION_TABLE.md + an evidence
log entry. Guards: refuses source==target (self-comparison is not
delegation evidence); a category stays "estimated" (inconclusive)
below --min-samples (default 2).

Blocked on data, not code: `requests.db` has only `intern` traffic (no
`lead` rows — no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY). Ran live against the current log:
`python shadow_eval.py --source-model lead --target-model intern`
correctly reports "no successful 'lead' requests in range" rather than
fabricating a verdict. Next real run needs `lead`-tier traffic — via
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY on `lead`/`lead-sonnet`, or once added, a Gemini/Groq
free-tier alias (see below).

# Current Task (Authoritative)

gateway/shadow_eval.py is implemented and tested (2026-07-03) — see
"Current Objective" above for what it does and its guards. Remaining
work on Phase 1 step 5 is data, not code: get real `lead`-tier traffic
into requests.db, then run
`python shadow_eval.py --source-model lead --target-model intern --update-table`
to produce the first evidence-backed DELEGATION_TABLE.md verdicts.
Options to unblock, in the order discussed with the Architect:

1. Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and route real project traffic through
   `lead` (or the `lead-sonnet` test alias already in config.yaml).
2. Add Gemini/Groq free-tier aliases to config.yaml (planned, not yet
   done — see above) for a frontier-ish baseline at $0.

## Research Notes for Later Phases (2026-07-03)

Recorded in docs/RELATED_WORK.md and DELEGATION_TABLE.md
("External Evidence"); key operational implications:

- Phase 2 Router: evaluate RouteLLM (open source, OpenAI-compatible)
  before building our own; it trains on preference data the Ledger and
  Shadow Evaluation will produce.
- Context-repetition priors to confirm locally: 50–62% of spend is
  re-sent history, 30–40% of tokens are redundant.

This file is intended to be updated frequently.
